I'm not losing my war that's in my mind
And I will spread my wings and soar
And I will fly and no, I will never deny
What's in my heart, what's in my life, will be justified
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
They will not weaken me
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
Will weaken me, that's for sure
And I won't be afraid of taking this out
I know I'll be safe and sound
'Cause you will be with me
Fighting in all these rounds
And I'll shout out so loud
I know without a doubt
That I'll be standing there when you go down
'Cause all these things I've seen
Well, now I'll try my best
And you will be with me to never second guess
And we will show the world just how we passed this test
And we will show the world we're better than this mess
'Cause I'm not losing my war that's in my mind
And I will spread my wings and soar
And I will fly and no, I will never deny
What's in my heart, what's in my life, will be justified
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
They will not weaken me
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
Well, we're not weakening, that's for sure
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
And mean lies and mean plots
And mean thoughts and cheap shots
Won't last for long
'Cause all these things I've seen, well, now I'll try my best
And you will be with me to never second guess
And we will show the world just how we passed this test
And we will show the world we're better than this mess
'Cause I'm not losing my war that's in my mind
And I will spread my wings and soar
Because I will fly and no, I will never deny
What's in my heart, what's in my life, will be justified
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
They will not weaken me
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
Well, we're not weakening, that's for sure
The mean thoughts and cheap shots
And mean lies and mean plots
And mean thoughts and cheap shots
Won't last for long
